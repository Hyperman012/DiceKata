# DiceKata
Model a six-sided die by specifying the values on its front (center), top, and right faces. 

All values must be between 1 and 6, with no repeats. Each face has an opposite such that the two sides add to 7 (e.g. 1 is opposite 6, 2 is opposite 5, 3 is opposite 4).

The Die class should support rotating the die in four directions: up, down, left, and right â€” each rotation returns a new Die instance, leaving the original unchanged.

This kata offers practice with both test-driven development and modeling immutable state.
